Maximise the sum, 
you will be given N intervals, where iâ€™th interval will start at time Li and will be finished at Ri and contains the special value Ki, You have to select P intervals such that no intervals overlap each other and maximize the sum of special values of the selected P intervals.

Constraints :-
1<= N <= 10^5
1<= P <= 10^2
1<= N*P <= 10^6
1<= Li , Ri <= 10^9
1<=Ki <= 10^6

Example :-

consider N=3 and P=2 and 
the intervals are
1 3 10
2 5 15
5 7 6
Here the answer is 16 , 
as taking 1st and 3rd intervals 
will be optimal

Input Format :-
first line contains N and P
N lines follow 3 space separated 
integers Li , Ri , Ki

Sample Input
3 2
1 3 10
2 5 15
5 7 6

Sample Output
16
